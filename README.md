# BuffBuffer

Addon that shows a toast notification for each aura (buff or debuff) you recieve.

`/buffer` (or open from Interface Options) to manage ignored auras. Use [Toaster](https://www.wowace.com/projects/toaster) to configure appearance and behavior of toasts.

## TODOS

- [ ] Differentiate between buffs and debuffs (e.g. text or title color).
